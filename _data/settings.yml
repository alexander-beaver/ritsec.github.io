      March 5th - March 7th 2021. The Information Security Talent Search is an annual three-day cyber
      attack/defend competition typically hosted in the early spring at RIT.
      Every year, competitors from both RIT and invited colleges from around the
      country are faced with a wide variety of challenges which are designed to
      cover as many facets of the security industry as possible. This includes
      defensive and offensive capabilities, system administration, software
      security, networking, programming, and much more! Challenges and activities
      include a CTF, King-of-the-Hill, policy writing, incident response, and
      code review -- all while defending a completely student-built
      infrastructure!
